Yeah, I remember
that dress and them shoes.

Jesus, man, come on!

WOMAN (over phone):
Where are you coming from?

175
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,398
Um...

176
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,775
I was at Happy’s
with some of the boys.

177
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,277
(scoffs) Another boys’ night
with your Navy SEALs?

JOHN:
How’s my girl?

186
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,087
(sighs) Pregnant.

187
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,339
You should try it.

188
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,051
-(sighs) -Oh, actually, I was
talking about my other girl.

189
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:0,137
-Oh. Excuse me.
-Mm-hmm.

190
00:12:0,220 --> 00:12:2,180
So, what, you doing good, baby?

191
00:12:2,264 --> 00:12:4,307
Daddy can’t wait
for you to get here.

192
00:12:4,391 --> 00:12:7,018
We got your room all picked out.

193
00:12:7,102 --> 00:12:9,229
Yeah, wait. What was that?

194
00:12:9,312 --> 00:12:11,731
Oh. She says she’s gonna be
a daddy’s girl.

195

-Oh, God, I doubt it.
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

It’s two against one.

You know what? I surrender.

198

...how much it turns me on
when you wear my socks, right?

-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

204
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,674
And you got ’em on.

205

-Mm-mm.
-Mm-hmm.

206
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,928
John, no, I really need
to go to sleep tonight.

207
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,930
No, I know, you...
you can go to sleep.

-I just... It’s gonna be quick.

-No.

-Hands up!
-Don’t shoot! I’m military!

00:36:1,869 --> 00:36:3,287
Get your hands behind your head!

497
00:36:3,370 --> 00:36:6,290
REPORTER: Literally hours
before the Dulles attack,

498
00:36:6,373 --> 00:36:8,709
an anonymous source releases
classified documents

499
00:36:8,792 --> 00:36:11,044
that tie the Russian government
to the attacks

500
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,172
on our Navy SEALs
here in the U.S.,

501
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,675
and you’re telling me
that’s coincidental?

502
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,844
I’m saying I’d be wary
about accusing

503
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,305
the Russian state
of assassinating

504
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,515
U.S. service members
on American soil.

505
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,225
(mutes TV)

506
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,271
RITTER: We didn’t leak
the Russian thing.

507
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,814
I mean, why would we?

508
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,733
We were the ones
trying to cover it up.

509
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,405
And as a courtesy,
Director Dillard thought

510
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,116
you might want to know
how Kelly got to Vaseliev.

511
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,661
Lieutenant Commander Greer?

512
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,246
Yeah, we can’t prove it.

513
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,625
Although, as I recall,
you were quite insistent

514
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,919
that she be briefed
on the matter.

515
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,130
She did seem resourceful.

516
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:0,344
There is the obvious concern
that this new development

517
00:37:0,427 --> 00:37:2,512
sends the wrong message
to Moscow.

518
00:37:2,596 --> 00:37:4,264
The wrong message?

519
00:37:6,266 --> 00:37:8,477
They hit us at home.

520
00:37:8,560 --> 00:37:10,604
Now they’re paying attention.

521
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,440
And Kelly has
a big target on his back.

522
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,401
Even in prison,
he won’t be safe.

523
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:20,697
Some situations warrant
thinking outside the box.

524
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,622
Has it occurred to you
that John Kelly

525
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,458
perhaps has done
something we can’t?

526
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,753
He shook a tree
that needed shaking.

527
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,088
So...

528
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,132
...let’s see who else falls out.

529
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,220
You’re pretty messy right now.

530
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,806
In more ways than one.

531
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,891
No, I’m not.

532
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,688
I spent half my life
playing that game.

533
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,318
I’m the one that went to hell
and did their dirty work.

534
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:2,864
We served a country
that didn’t love us back.

535
00:38:4,324 --> 00:38:7,285
Because we believed
in what it could be.

536
00:38:7,369 --> 00:38:10,414
We fought for what
America could be.

537
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,084
But they crossed a line.

538
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,963
They brought their war
into my house.

539
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,510
They took my wife.

540
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,099
And they took my baby girl

541
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,393
before she got a chance
to take a breath.

542
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,524
That contract is broken.

543
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,153
They’re gonna play
by my rules now.

544
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:46,158
I’ll show them
what a pawn can do to a king.

on those Russians,

Sir, if this guy’s

then you need somebody like me.

that Senior Chief Kelly is not

in the right state of mind
to be in the field right now.

you will return

01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:1,638
Hey, hey,
I won’t leave you here.

986
01:09:1,720 --> 01:09:3,056
-(groaning continues)
-It’s not naptime.

987
01:09:3,139 --> 01:09:4,307
JOHN: Cover me, cover me,
cover me, cover me.

988
01:09:4,390 --> 01:09:6,101
Move.

989
01:09:6,184 --> 01:09:8,185
(grunting)

990
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,523
(bullet strikes wall)

991
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,361
Coming back to you.
Crossing, crossing, crossing!

992
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,947
-(groaning, panting)
-(gunfire)

Dallas, hang in there, buddy!

-Third floor, second window!

995
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,843
-Lay down some cover!
-I’m pinned down! Cover fire!

996
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:47,392
You’re covered! Get him!
Go, go, go!

997
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,019
(groaning continues)

998
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,728
Come on.

999
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,565
Second sniper!

1000
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:54,941
(gunfire continues)

1001
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:58,403
There’s a second sniper!

1002
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,905
12 o’clock!

1003
01:10:6,411 --> 01:10:7,787

1004

1005

Get him out of there!

1010
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,719
Get me out of here!

1011
01:10:23,803 --> 01:10:25,555
(groaning, strained grunting)

1012
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,684
Goddamn it.

1013
01:10:30,769 --> 01:10:32,145
(groaning continues)

1014
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,772
Shit!

1015
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,981
Hey.

1016
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,067
Ritter, this in the brief?

1017
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,112
-We need an out.
-Thunder’s down!

1018
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:42,822
There’s a sniper
covering the entry point!

1019
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,491
We need to find another way!

1020
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,159
You still in the fight, Thunder?

1021
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,662
Still in the game, ma’am.
I got our six.

1022
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,163
All right.

1023
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,876
I’m screening the situation.

1024
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,003
Hatchet, Kelly, cover me.

1025
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,296
-Got you.
-Moving. -Moving.

1026
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:0,048
Covering fire!

1027
01:11:0,130 --> 01:11:1,383
(groans)

1028
01:11:5,804 --> 01:11:7,764
We got to frag that sniper.

1029
01:11:7,847 --> 01:11:9,599
-(siren approaching)
-(gunfire)

1030
01:11:9,683 --> 01:11:10,850
GREER:
Cease fire.

1031
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,978
-(gunfire stops)
-Cease fire.

1032
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,609

1033
01:11:24,072 --> 01:11:25,573

(panting)

1039
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,795
They just killed
two police officers.

1040
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,759
Shit.

1041
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,844
’Cause it looks like we did it.

1042
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,728
The dead Russians in my house.

1043
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,523
They wanted us to find ’em.

1044
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:0,358
They wanted us to find
a dead Russian soldier

1045
01:12:0,442 --> 01:12:2,318
on American soil.

1046
01:12:3,611 --> 01:12:5,822
And if we die here,
then they’ll find a bunch

1047
01:12:5,905 --> 01:12:8,742
of dead American soldiers
on Russian soil, too.

1048
01:12:9,826 --> 01:12:11,577
JOHN:
And if we kill a couple cops

1049
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,788
on the way out of here,
even better.

1050
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,248
GREER:
Jesus.

1051
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,500
(distant sirens wailing)

1052
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,502
Everything--

1053
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:22,213
the assassination of the team,

1054
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,341
my house, this op--

1055
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,427
it was a setup
from the beginning.

1056
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,514
They’re trying to start a war.

1057
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,983
Like Rykov said,

1058
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:44,277
now all we got to do is die.

1059
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,407
GREER:
Yeah, we’re not gonna do that.

1060
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:51,076
All right.

1061
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:53,077
We got to take out
this sniper in the hallway.

1062
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,788
I need you to buy us an exit.

1063
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,331
Tracking.

1064
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:0,126
-Moving.
-Thunder, pass me your pack.

1065

1068
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:19,603
JOHN:
Stay in it. Stay in it, fellas.

1069
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,272
HATCHET:
All right.

1070
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,108
I got him. I got him.

1071
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,652
RITTER:
All clear!

1072
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:28,612
(gunfire continues)

1073
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,701
JOHN: All right.
Let’s move. Let’s move.

1074

(chatter in Russian)

1077
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:58,768
Hold tight!
We’re making a way!

1078
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:0,853
Push, push, push!

1079
01:14:6,192 --> 01:14:7,443

Time to go,
time to go, time to go!

1099
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,693
Get out of here! Go!

set him down.

to tell ’em?

Tell ’em, um,

1121

I love them.

1122

Sure.

1123

I’m gonna get up to the roof
and clear a path for you guys.

We’re not leaving you behind.

We can’t leave anybody behind.

1131
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:42,241
If we leave a trace,
they’re going to get their war.

1132
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,452
You got to get the team
out of here.

1133
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:47,705
To them, I’m not a soldier.

1134
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,919
I’m a felon.

1135
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,004
I can die here.

1136
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,425

And who’s gonna run
that kind of thing?
